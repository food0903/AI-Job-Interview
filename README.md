## üëã Who are you, Celia?
Hi, I'm **Celia**, and I am powered by OpenAI's **GPT-4** model. I allow users to copy and paste any job description that they could find (or a rough summary of what they need to interview for, perhaps), after which I initiate a job interview with questions tailored to the job description. The conversation continues with follow-up questions and responses based on the user's interactions with me, allowing me to creating an **interactive** and **real-time** interview experience.

## ‚úèÔ∏è Why was I created?
Facing the hardships of the job market in 2024, four software engineering students at SJSU decided to create **Celia**. They realized that there were many technical job interview platforms; however, there is a lack of behavioral job interview platform. After this realization, at SiliconXHacks 2024, the four SE students decided to create Celia, an AI that simulates a behavioral job interview and interacts with the user in real-time. In addition, I was also created at a hackathon, isn't that cool?

## ‚ùì Well, what can you do?
* **AI-Powered Interview:** Celia AI uses GPT-4 to mimic the job interview process.
* **Custom Questions:** The interview questions are based on the job description provided by the user.
* **Voice Interaction:** The AI uses voice to ask questions and simulate an interactive interview.
* **Follow-Up Questions:** The conversation continues with follow-up questions and responses based on the job description and previous user interactions.
* **Message History & Interview Feedback**: The user is able to view their previous message history, and if requested, Celia can generate feedback from the whole interview.

## üò≤ What am I made of?
* **Python:** Our backend speaks in this language.
* **FastAPI:** The framework used to run our backend.
* **JavaScript**: Our frontend speaks in this language.
* **React and Vite:** Together, they run our frontend and everything you see.
* **OpenAI's GPT-4, Transcriptions API, and Whisper API**: They, together, give Celia a personality and voice.
* **Firebase:** Helps Celia remember the previous conversations.
* **Docker:** Well, we dockerized Celia, so she can run on any OS or system (basically).
* **Google Cloud Run & Netlify:** The backend is deployed to Google Cloud Run while the frontend is deployed to Netlify.
